class TimeChannelParser:
    """
    Parser class which includes parsing functions for measurements data of the form time_stamp, channel, additional_information_column.
    The methods parse the fata, filters negative counts and requires alert_column == 0.
    The class can filter into DataFrame or into Spectrum.
    The class is mainly for the auther use but is relevant for studies with similar MCA's.

    Methods
    -------
    to_dataframe(time_channel_path: str, sep=' ', skiprows=5)
     Filter the time_channel file from pileup and negative counts
    to_spectrum(time_channel_path: str,
                    energy_calibration_poly=np.poly1d([1, 0]), fwhm_calibration=None,
                    sep=' ',  skiprows=5,
                    num_of_channels=2 ** 14)
     Filter the time_channel file from pileup and negative counts,
    then transform data to spectrum using the calibrations
    counts_in_time_into_spectrum(cls, time_channel_df: pd.DataFrame, num_of_channels=2 ** 14)
     Takes a data frame with time stemp, count and pileup and turn into spectrum in dataframe form
